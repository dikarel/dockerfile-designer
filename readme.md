# dockerfile-designer

Compose a Dockerfile via drag-n-drop

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dikarel/dockerfile-designer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dikarel/dockerfile-designer)

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Motivation

Handcrafting Dockerfiles is fun at first, but gets tiring after a while.
Typing the same magic incantations again and again - hoping you don't screw
something up along the way - is at best tedious. In addition, navigating opaque
package manager sites isn't exactly the best use of time.

We need a way to quickly cobble together Dockerfiles that just work.
